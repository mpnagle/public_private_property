# The STARTUP options control how org-mode looks and act by setting
# preferences at startup.  We are using the following preferences:
#
# - "showall" starts org-mode with all the headlines
# [[glossary:org-mode visibility cycling][expanded].
# - "logdone" sets org-mode to record the time and date when a TODO is
# completed.
# - "lognotedone" sets org-mode to ask for a [[glossary:org-mode notes][note]] when a TODO is
# done.
# - "logrepeat" sets org-mode to record when a TODO which
# [[glossary:org-mode repeating tasks][repeats]] is completed.
# - "lognoteclock-out" sets org-mode to ask for a [[glossary:org-mode notes][note]] when you
# [[glossary:time tracking][clock out]] of a task.
# - "hidestars" hides all but the last star in a headline, to
# [[][enhance readability]].
# - "odd" sets org-mode to only use odd numbers of stars in headlines,
# to [[][enhance readability].

# At sprout, we try to keep track of how much time we expect things to
# take, and then how much they actually do.  These configuration lines
# let us set up a way to attach a [[glossary:org-mode
# property]["property]] to a TODO where we can set our time estimate,
# and then record how long the task actually took by
# [[glossary:time-tracking][clocking in and out]].  The "Effort_ALL"
# PROPERTY sets the available time increments.  The "COLUMNS" property
# defines columns for [[glossary:emacs column-mode][column-mode]].  In
# this case, those columns are the task, the estimated time, and the
# total time clocked (CLOCKSUM).  The "%#" parts of the line indicate
# how many characters wide each column should be (%70 = 70 characters
# wide, for instance.)

# <<fileDescription>>
This todo.org file is for recording tasks associated with the
${projectname} project.  Take a look at the [[][sprout doshit
guidelines]] for the details and the [[][sprout doshit tutorial]] for
more information on doing shit with doshit.

A quick summary of the guidelines:
 - No scheduled task should be expected to take more than six hours.
   If you don't know how long a task will take, create a TODO for
   figuring that out.
 - No scheduled task should be unassigned.  If you don't know who will
   do it, create a task for figuring that out and make someone
   responsible for following up.
 - No task should go without a deadline if it can be avoided.  If it
   is not clear when the deadline should be, do not set it
   arbitrarily.  Create another TODO for assessing how long the given
   task(s) will take and set a deadline on that.
 - Each TODO should be assigned to exactly one person.  If you want
   several people to do a task, copy and paste that task and tag each
   instance with their name.
 - Estimate how long a task will take, and be sure to track the time
   you spend on it, commenting as to what progress you made each time
   you clock in and out.  See [[][time tracking in doshit at sprout]]
 - The only person setting the priority of a task should be the person
   who is doing it.

If you're having any issues with doshit, drop [[mailto:doshit@sproutward.org][doshit@sproutward.org]] a
line, or drop by [[irc:/sprout/irc.freenode.net][#sprout]] on IRC.
